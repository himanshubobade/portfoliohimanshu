#     I am back, after a few days of vacationing with family. Weather was awesome, the beach was
#     full of nasty jelly-fish, yuk! All-in-all, life has been good. I hope life has been as
#     good for all of you.
#     </p>
#     <p class="lead">
#     My area of focus lies in designing web and mobile products, user research as well as
#     leading of design & front-end teams. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as
#     talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals.
