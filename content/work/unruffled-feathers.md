            description: "Worked with a team of 20+ interns to deliver this project. Image Captioning: Tuned parameters and trained models on Flickr 8k, Flickr 30k, and larger image datasets to generate accurate captions. Custom YOLOv3 Model: Implemented object detection to identify multiple classes of objects in images with high precision. Audio Analysis: Extracted audio tracks and processed keywords to enhance context-based recommendations. Eye Heat Map Algorithm: Optimized gaze-tracking to detect on-screen eye movements, providing insight into user attention. Text Summarization: Condensed textual data into concise summaries, highlighting core information for quicker consumption. Brand Logo Detection: Developed models to locate and recognize brand logos within images, aiding brand-focused analytics. Similarity Matrix: Employed Cosine, spaCy, and Wu-Palmer similarity measures, coupled with normalization, to compute content similarity. Recommendation System Backend: Built the initial codebase, integrating these AI/ML modules (image captioning, audio analysis, object detection, etc.) into a cohesive recommendation pipeline. Leveraged TensorFlow and other ML frameworks to achieve 87% accuracy with the custom similarity matrix, alongside CNN-based object detection, eye-tracking, text/audio summarization, and brand-logo detection."
